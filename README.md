# BDS-Manager
This is a personal project, so please don't expect much. The sole purpose of this is to manage the Bedrock Dedicated Server with a UI. Put the Python file and the playit.gg file in the same place as the bedrock_server.exe file. 
This Manager is also made with the bedrock-server-1.21.60.10, so if it updates... I may not notice the difference lol
